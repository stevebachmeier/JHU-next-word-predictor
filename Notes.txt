Questions:
----------
* Should I remove n-grams already found in higher order n-grams (eg remove "do I do" if "what do I do" existed)?
* How can I speed up building the lists of ngrams?
* 

Suggestions:
------------
* Find an R profiler to hunt for bottlenecks.
* Remove words found in 2+ grams from the unigrams (to prevent repeated words, eg I have a a)
*

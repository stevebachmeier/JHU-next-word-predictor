This is the final capstone project for the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization.

## Data
The data used for this project is provided by Swiftkey. It includes databases for twitter, blogs, and news sources in four different languages; I focus only on english

** Note that I do not include the data sets as they are too large **
